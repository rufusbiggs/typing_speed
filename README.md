# Typing Speed Game

This is a simple typing speed game built using Python and the `curses` library. The game was created as a learning project to explore the basics of terminal-based UI development with `curses`.

## How to Play
- The game starts when you press any key.
- A random sentence will appear on the screen.
- Type the sentence as quickly and accurately as possible.
- Your typing speed (characters per minute) will be displayed at the end.
- Press `Esc` to exit the game.

## Features
- Real-time character-by-character accuracy checking.
- Live typing speed calculation (characters per minute).
- Simple terminal-based UI with color formatting.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `curses` (included in standard Python library for Linux/macOS, requires `windows-curses` on Windows)

## Running the Game
```sh
python main.py
